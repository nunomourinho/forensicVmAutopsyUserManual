Snapshots in ForensicVM: A Crucial Asset for Investigators
==========================================================

Why snapshots are so important for a forensic investigation
------------------------------------------------------------

In the dynamic realm of digital forensics, the ability to preserve, replicate, and revert to specific states of digital evidence is paramount. Snapshots in ForensicVM offer this essential capability. Here's an in-depth look at why snapshots are indispensable for forensic investigators:

Base Snapshot: The Pristine Beginning
***************************************

The *base snapshot* or sometimes referred to as the 'first snapshot,' is a reflection of the initial state of a system or a piece of evidence. Just as a crime scene investigator would secure a scene to ensure no contamination occurs, in digital forensics, the base snapshot acts as that secured, untouched crime scene. It represents the data in its original, unaltered form, enabling investigators to always have a pristine reference point.

Preserving Evidence Integrity
******************************

Digital evidence, by its very nature, is volatile. A single action, intentional or accidental, can alter the evidence, possibly rendering it inadmissible in court. Snapshots act as safety nets. Should the evidence be unintentionally modified or corrupted, investigators can easily revert to a previous snapshot, ensuring the integrity of the evidence remains uncompromised.

Embracing "What-If" Analysis
*****************************

Forensic investigation often involves a series of "what-if" scenarios. Investigators may want to test a hypothesis or simulate actions that a suspect might have taken. With snapshots, these simulations can be executed without the risk of permanently altering the evidence. After an analysis, the system can be reverted to its original state using the snapshot, ready for another hypothesis to be tested.

Additional Considerations
**************************

1. **Documentation and Chain of Custody**: Every snapshot can serve as a documented step in the investigative process, aiding in maintaining a clear chain of custody.

2. **Efficiency and Speed**: Instead of restoring from backups or original sources, which can be time-consuming, snapshots allow for quick reversion, making the investigative process more efficient.

3. **Risk Mitigation**: Especially in complex cases involving malware or unknown data structures, snapshots provide a safety mechanism, allowing investigators to explore without risking the primary evidence source or the investigation platform.



Create a new snapshot
-----------------------

It is highly recommended to create your first snapshot immediately after the machine begins its booting process. Doing so preserves the initial state of the ForensicVM, making it easier to revert back to a clean state at any time during your investigation. Snapshots can be invaluable during forensic investigations, especially when you need to return to a specific point in time or recover from potential mistakes.

**Create a snapshot**

    1. **Open the Autopsy ForensicVM Client**: Ensure you have the Autopsy ForensicVM Client interface launched and ready.

    2. **Navigate to Snapshot Management**: This section is dedicated to creating, viewing, and managing snapshots of your ForensicVM.

    3. **Initiate Snapshot Creation**:
   
    - Click on the "Create new" button located within the Snapshot management area.

Once you've successfully created a snapshot, it will be saved and listed in the Snapshot management section. You can then access this snapshot whenever needed to revert your ForensicVM to that particular state.
