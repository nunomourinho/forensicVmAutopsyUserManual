WebShell for Remote Administration
==================================

For enhanced remote server administration, a webshell has been crafted based on the `shellinabox` project which has been adapted into a Django application. This allows secure root access to the server, making it an invaluable tool for troubleshooting and remote server management tasks.

**Accessing the WebShell**:

There are two primary methods to access the WebShell:

1. **Through the Autopsy ForensicVM Client Plugin**:

   - Within the plugin interface, click on the *Open ForensicVM WebShell* button. This action will open the WebShell in your default browser.
