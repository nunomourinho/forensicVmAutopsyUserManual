Plugin Architecture overview
===============================

One of the key features of ForensicVM is its plugin architecture, which enables the community to extend its functionality and interact with forensic images in innovative ways. This open architecture fosters the development of new software that can interact with forensic images, providing flexibility and promoting active community involvement.

Through the plugin architecture, developers can create tools to perform a variety of tasks, including but not limited to:

- **Password Administration**: Reset forgotten passwords or generate new administrator accounts to gain access to the systems encapsulated in the forensic image.
- **Hibernate File Management**: Remove hibernation files to remove state of the system at the time of hibernation.
- **Data Extraction and Analysis**: Extract and analyze data from a forensic image to uncover evidence or gain insights into the operation of the system.

By contributing plugins to the community, developers can help to improve ForensicVM, enriching it with new features and capabilities. Moreover, by utilizing the plugins developed by the community, users can tailor ForensicVM to their specific needs, creating a more versatile and powerful forensic analysis environment.
