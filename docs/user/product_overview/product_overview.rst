=====================
Product Overview
=====================

ForensicVM is a powerful tool in digital forensics. It simplifies the investigation process by allowing the virtualization and management of forensic images. 

ForensicVM Architecture
==========================

ForensicVM is composed of two main components:

- **The Client**: The client provides a user-friendly interface for managing forensic images, allowing users to create, run, and decommission instances as needed. It supports a variety of forensic image formats, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of existing tools and workflows.

- **The Hypervisor**: The hypervisor is responsible for the execution of the virtualized forensic images. It manages resources and isolation between instances, ensuring that each virtual machine runs effectively and securely.

Understanding the Interface
==============================

ForensicVM's interface is designed with usability in mind. It provides a clear view of the current state of your forensic images, including active instances, and the status of any ongoing analysis tasks. It also provides easy access to ForensicVM's suite of analysis tools, making it simple to start investigating a forensic image.

Plugin Architecture
======================

One of the key features of ForensicVM is its plugin architecture, which enables the community to extend its functionality and interact with forensic images in innovative ways. This open architecture fosters the development of new software that can interact with forensic images, providing flexibility and promoting active community involvement.

Through the plugin architecture, developers can create tools to perform a variety of tasks, including but not limited to:

- **Password Administration**: Reset forgotten passwords or generate new administrator accounts to gain access to the systems encapsulated in the forensic image.
- **Hibernate File Management**: Remove hibernation files to remove state of the system at the time of hibernation.
- **Data Extraction and Analysis**: Extract and analyze data from a forensic image to uncover evidence or gain insights into the operation of the system.

By contributing plugins to the community, developers can help to improve ForensicVM, enriching it with new features and capabilities. Moreover, by utilizing the plugins developed by the community, users can tailor ForensicVM to their specific needs, creating a more versatile and powerful forensic analysis environment.
