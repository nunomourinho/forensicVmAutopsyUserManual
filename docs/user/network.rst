Managing the Network Card to Capture and Analyse Network Traffic
=================================================================

By default, the forensicVM initiates with its network card disabled. This design choice is deliberate, to minimize the potential risks of activating a network card on a possibly compromised virtual forensic machine. Activating such a network card could jeopardize not only your individual computer but the broader network environment.

For many forensic investigations, an active network connection is unnecessary. When evidence is solely contained within a local device, it's recommended to keep the network card deactivated. This approach ensures the machine's safe operation and the security of your enterprise network or domain.

However, in certain situations, there may be a need to activate the network card. For instance, when the forensic virtual machine is deemed safe and requires an internet connection to retrieve cloud-based dataâ€”data sourced from cached cloud access credentials like those from OneDrive, Google Drive, Nextcloud, OwnCloud, etc. In such cases, the forensicVM's network card can be enabled. This card has an 
inbuilt firewall designed to block access to identified local networks while permitting internet connections. Additionally, every time the network card is toggled on or off, all inbound and outbound traffic is recorded. This leads to the creation of a Wireshark pcap file for each activation and deactivation event.

   It's paramount to treat the activation of the network card as a method of last    resort. Alternatively, consider using a remotely hosted forensicVM server. The integrity of the firewall isn't foolproof, meaning there's always a risk that malicious software might infiltrate your network. Furthermore, a compromised machine could ping back to an attacker, potentially revealing your external IP address and inadvertently notifying a malicious actor that they are under active investigation!

Enable the Network Card
------------------------

To activate the network card on the forensicVM, there are two methods available. The first method involves using the Autopsy ForensicVM client plugin interface, and the second requires directly interacting with the web screen interface through the network icon.

Enable Network Using the Web Screen Interface
************************************************

Activating the network card can also be achieved via the Web Screen Interface. This method allows users to manage network settings without diving into the main software interface. Here's how to enable the network card using the Web Screen Interface:

**Activating Network through Web Screen Interface Steps**

1. Initiate the **Panel Opener (1)** to reveal the available options.
2. Locate and click on the **network icon (2)** to access network settings.
3. Identify and click the red button labeled **Enable network (caution) (3)** to activate the network card.

Reseting the Operating System Network Card
*******************************************

From time to time, due to various reasons such as IP conflicts, connectivity issues, or configuration errors, it might be necessary to reset the network card. Resetting can re-establish a proper connection and can often solve common networking problems. Below are methods to reset the network card in Windows and Linux.

**Windows 10**

In Windows 10, the Network Troubleshooter can assist in diagnosing and resolving common network-related problems.

1. Navigate to the system tray located in the bottom right corner of your screen.
2. Right-click the network icon.
3. From the context menu, select the "Troubleshoot problems" option. The Network Troubleshooter will now start, and it will attempt to diagnose and resolve any detected issues.

**Other Windows Versions**

In older versions of Windows, the process might slightly differ. Usually, there's a network troubleshooting tool available but its location or name may vary. Check under "Network and Sharing Center" or within Control Panel for related options.

**Linux**

In Linux, depending on the distribution and the desktop environment, you can manage the network card through the graphical interface. However, for a more universal method:

1. Open a terminal.
2. To disable the network card (assuming it's named `eth0`), type: 
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ifconfig eth0 down

3. To enable it again, type:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ifconfig eth0 up

.. danger::

   Always proceed with caution when enabling the network, especially on systems that are meant for forensic investigations or are potentially compromised. It's vital to ensure systems and network security and to be aware of the risks involved.

Collect Network Evidence
-------------------------

Enabling the network card is often crucial for forensic investigations, especially when collecting evidence from cloud services. This is particularly relevant when users have not logged out from a service or when session cookies remain in the browser. Such scenarios allow forensic investigators to trace digital breadcrumbs and gather additional evidence that may be inaccessible from offline forensic images. Below are two illustrative examples:

**Gathering Data from Cloud Services - OneDrive Example**

The following figure demonstrates data extraction from OneDrive, a popular online cloud service.

Analyze network traffic in Wireshark
--------------------------------------

Analyzing network traffic is an integral part of digital forensic investigations, especially when attempting to reconstruct a sequence of events or identify malicious activities. Using a tool like Wireshark to analyze traffic from a forensic image virtual machine can provide investigators with a wealth of information. However, this approach comes with its advantages and potential pitfalls.

**Importance of Analyzing Traffic in Forensic Investigations**

1. **Evidence Collection**: Analyzing traffic can reveal communication with suspicious IP addresses, hinting at potential data exfiltration or command-and-control servers.
2. **User Behavior**: Network traffic can provide clues about user behavior, including sites visited, files downloaded, or apps used.
3. **Timestamps**: Traffic analysis can help in reconstructing timelines of events, crucial for correlating actions across different evidence sources.
4. **Detect Malware**: Unusual network traffic patterns can be indicative of malware communication.


**Advantages**

1. **Comprehensive Data View**: Wireshark offers a detailed view of packets, allowing forensic investigators to delve deep into the network interactions.
2. **Filtering and Searching**: With its advanced filtering options, investigators can isolate relevant data quickly.
3. **Decoding Protocols**: Wireshark can decode a vast array of protocols, aiding in understanding the specifics of network conversations.
4. **Visualization**: Graphical features like flow graphs help in visualizing communication patterns.

**Dangers**

1. **Data Overload**: The volume of data in pcap files can be overwhelming, and without proper focus, important details might be missed.
2. **Privacy Concerns**: Analyzing traffic can inadvertently capture personal or sensitive information of innocent users.
3. **Tampered Data**: If the forensic image virtual machine is compromised, the network data might be tampered with, leading to incorrect conclusions.
4. **Misinterpretation**: Without proper expertise, normal traffic can be misinterpreted as malicious or vice versa.

.. note::

   While Wireshark is a powerful tool for forensic investigations, it's essential to approach the analysis with a clear understanding of the goals, the data's context, and the potential pitfalls. Proper training and experience can help in maximizing the benefits of traffic analysis while minimizing risks.
   Given the complexity and subtleties involved in network traffic analysis, it's recommended that forensic investigators continuously update their training and remain informed about the latest techniques and threats in the domain.


After extracting the pcap files, the next step is to analyze the network traffic captured during the period the network card was active. Here's how to proceed:

1. Navigate to the extracted pcap directory. If Wireshark isn't installed on your system, visit wireshark.org to download and install it. Once installed, Wireshark-associated icons will appear next to each pcap file.

2. Double-click the pcap file you wish to analyze.
