Purpose of ForensicVM
======================

ForensicVM is an innovative tool designed to streamline the process of digital forensics. By leveraging advanced virtualization technology, ForensicVM allows for the secure and efficient analysis of forensic images, making it an invaluable tool for cybersecurity professionals, digital forensics investigators, and information security teams.

Overview of Features
======================

ForensicVM offers a range of features designed to enhance the forensic analysis process:

- **Virtualization of** Forensic Images: ForensicVM enables the creation and management of virtualized instances of forensic images, paving the way for a more flexible and scalable analysis process. This virtualization can be executed either through a snapshot linked to the investigator's storage for quick selection or by full conversion, which transfers and converts the image to a remote server to maximize the VM's performance and features.
- **Forensic Image Lifecycle Management**: ForensicVM equips users with tools for managing every step of a forensic image's lifecycle, from creation to decommissioning. Convert the forensic image into a VM, start, stop, reset, snapshot, and safely delete the forensic image when it is no longer required.
- **Advanced Analysis Tools**: Equipped with a suite of powerful analysis tools, ForensicVM assists investigators in uncovering vital evidence.
- **Integrated** Hypervisor: The ForensicVM Server features a robust hypervisor based on QEMU and KVM to guarantee efficient execution and management of virtual machines.
- **Collaboration**: ForensicVM employs a web development strategy that fosters remote and secure collaboration among forensic investigators. This method enables team members, regardless of their location, to work simultaneously on investigations in a digital space, enhancing productivity and communication. It leverages advanced encryption and security protocols to ensure that all collaborative efforts remain secure and confidential, protecting the integrity of investigations. In essence, ForensicVM's approach melds convenience, connectivity, and security, revolutionizing the way forensic investigations are conducted.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Plugins applied to the forensic virtual machine enable security bypassing, like creating new admins, resetting Windows activation, patching accessibility, and also allow the community to develop custom solutions that interact with ForensicVM.
- **Evidence Disk**: An additional disk is automatically created with all tags from Autopsy Software, enabling easy and practical gathering and importing of evidence back to Autopsy.
- **Optional** Network Card: It is disabled by default but when activated, this network card records all network traffic on the server while protecting local networking from potential attacks with pre-installed firewall rules. It also records traffic in Wireshark PCAP format.
- **On-the-Fly** Memory Dumps: Capability to create volatility memory dumps at any moment.
- **Integrated Screenshots**: Removes the need for an extra screenshot program.
- **Integrated Video Recording**: Ability to record individual videos with a maximum duration of three hours, providing additional evidence if required.
- **Media Management**: ISO management allows investigators to use their own tools during the investigation.
- **Snapshot Management**: Freeze the VM in time and recall a previous state to perform "what if" tests.
- **Fine-tuning**: Adjust machine memory size and set the VM start date as needed.

.. WARNING::
   The network card is currently a work in progress. Under certain circumstances, the firewall rules may fail, potentially exposing your network to malicious actors. Please note that although the network safeguards your internal system, your external IP may still be visible if a C2C client is installed. Proceed with caution.

.. IMPORTANT::
   Video recording is also still under development. Currently, the recordings lack audio. This limitation is expected to be addressed in future updates.

Use Cases
==========

ForensicVM can be used in a variety of scenarios, including but not limited to:

- **Cybersecurity Investigations**: In the world of ever-evolving cyber threats, ForensicVM can be employed by investigators to thoroughly analyze cyberattacks. It allows experts to delve into the intricate details of these attacks, discover the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) deployed by adversaries, and thereby contribute to the broader understanding of emerging cyber threats.
- **Incident Response**: ForensicVM plays a pivotal role in the incident response process, helping to mitigate the impact of security incidents. In the aftermath of a security breach, it can quickly analyze the affected system, extracting crucial data that aids in understanding the extent of the compromise. This swift and thorough analysis can contribute to expedited recovery processes, aid in damage control, and provide insights for strengthening defenses to thwart future incidents.
- **Training and Education**: ForensicVM is an invaluable tool for training budding cybersecurity professionals. It offers a safe and controlled environment for trainees to learn and practice forensic analysis. Facilitating hands-on experience enables learners to understand the nuances of digital forensics, teaching them to uncover and interpret the digital evidence left behind after cyber incidents. In academic settings, ForensicVM can be integrated into cybersecurity curricula, ensuring that the future generation of cyber defenders is well-versed in the practical aspects of forensic analysis.
- **Legal Investigations**: ForensicVM can also be used in legal investigations where digital evidence plays a crucial role. Law enforcement agencies can use this tool to process and analyze digital evidence, which can provide vital leads in criminal investigations.
- **Corporate Audits and Investigations**: Organizations can utilize ForensicVM in their internal audits and investigations. This tool can assist in identifying suspicious activities or misconduct, ensuring the organization's policies and regulations are being adhered to, and maintaining a secure and compliant work environment.
