   forensicVM
      A specialized virtual machine that operates on a hypervisor and is utilized in digital forensic investigations. It is created through the conversion of a forensic image into a virtual machine format. The operating system is detected, and necessary drivers are installed to replicate the functionality of the original system. An initial snapshot is created to preserve the original state. The forensicVM simulates the original computer or server within a safe and controlled environment, allowing detailed examination without risk to other systems.

   ISO
      ISO 9660 (also known as ECMA-119) is a file system for optical disc media. The file system is an international standard available from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Since the specification is available for anybody to purchase, implementations have been written for many operating systems (Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660)

   VM
      Virtual machine - In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is the virtualization or emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide the functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of the two. Virtual machines differ and are organized by their function, shown here:
         System virtual machines (also called full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide the functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments that are isolated from one another yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, with virtualization-specific hardware features on the host CPUs providing assistance to hypervisors.
